<h1>Forelli Redemption FAQ</h1>
<b>Q: What is this?</b>
<p>A: As you can see, it's a mod for GTA III, and it's called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/gta-fr">Forelli Redemption</a> as the title suggests (by 1826 and leshenka). It features new missions based on a hypothetical background scenario for the Forellis in GTA III, alongside new collectibles and side-missions.</p>
<br>
<b>Q: ...</b>
<p>A: Yes, I'm going for 100%.</p>
<br>
<b>Q: Will you play other total conversion mods?</b>
<p>A: I'm looking at GTA III Frosted Winter and GTAVC Shine o' Vice as ones that I've been meaning to get around to for some time.</p>
<br>
<b>Q: Will you speedrun this?</b>
<p>A: ... Maybe. Doing a 100% run of this could be interesting. At least Paramedic and Taxi are cut in half, too (though no Taxi duping). But I'm not exactly a GTA III 100% expert, so it wouldn't be anything too amazing I guess.</p>
