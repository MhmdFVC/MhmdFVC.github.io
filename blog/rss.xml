            <description>So, Japan. It's the peaceful land of cherry blossoms, ancient shrines and temples, beautiful nature, four distinct seasons, high social cohesion, low crime rate; of anime and visual novels, and a wide assortment of video games; of dedicated craftsmen and of social conservatism. It's a country that I have taken quite a liking to. Seems like a wonderland, right? Well, not to even get into the issues with its working culture, but I fear there is something dark lurking beneath the surface.</description>
