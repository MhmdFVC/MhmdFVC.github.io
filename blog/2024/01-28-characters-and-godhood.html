        What is a character? The natural response might be “a fictional depiction of a human being”. Broken down into its parts, a character may be nothing more than a drawing. But breaking such things into their atomic constituents is of no use; it is like calling animals sacks of wet carbon. 
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        So, indeed, characters are depictions of humans. But characters can only “come to life” within each of our own minds. Our mutual perception that the characters are more than just drawings are what makes it so. The same could be said of all humans; we are fairly certain that other people exist, especially when we are perceiving them. But our mental image of them is what remains in our minds. It perhaps is not entirely untrue that those remembered postmortem are said to “live on” in the hearts of those who remember the deceased. Thus, it can be said that characters are real entities (or, “objects of human consideration”) insofar as we can hold the same feelings towards them, or interactions with them. 
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        Having feelings towards characters is simple. Interacting with them on your own terms is not as difficult as it used to be either, thanks to AI. But even if you are interacting with them in a more-or-less kinetic novel style (such as Blue Archive), you are still experiencing interactions with characters. Although other humans created their personalities, their dialogue, their images, and perhaps even their voices, the character comes to life in our minds as a unique person. When one considers that we ourselves as humans are not fully independent, and draw our personalities and habits from those in our own lives growing up, this is not so strange. Again, from this line of thinking, we can posit that characters are real entities, albeit not ones that tend to produce their own outputs (though again, this is changing).

         So even if characters do “really exist”, how does that make them gods as my title suggests? Well, to be clear first of all, I don’t literally mean a being which wields supernatural powers; the one almighty God alone possesses such capabilities. I mean god in terms of being “deified”; i.e., a character can be idolized, symbolize particular traits and aspects of our lives, and yet not be equivalent to us humans. These characters need not experience the hardships of real life, even if they may be portrayed to be doing so. These characters, for the most part, are technically are not required to eat; they cannot be communicated with in the same way as with a human; they do not exist in flesh and bone.

        It is no surprise, then, that so many characters come out of Japan. The animist foundations of Shintoism are a product of the seemingly-inherent human inclination to create gods. This can be observed in many religions of ancient civilizations, as well as some presently-practiced religions such as Hinduism. But many cultures have long-since become monotheistic. In Japan, this is not so, and characters remain an enormous part of their culture. Simply put, characters are modern-day gods. Not many nowadays care to sincerely believe in the creation myths of old, with gods for everything such as rain, wind, the Sun, moon, disease, etc., particularly with changes in mindset introduced by science. But non-god characters wield no supernatural powers, and even characters portrayed as gods wield their powers in a world that is not ours. Yet they too exist, because we can acknowledge their godhood in their alternate realm.

        Of course, this phenomenon is not limited to Japan. I am not personally familiar with the religious background of China and Korea (besides Buddhism), but it appears that similar tendencies with regard to characters can be observed in those countries as well. This can be observed by the fact that almost every East Asian online has a character as their profile picture. Of course, many non-East Asians do this, but I am speaking in terms of proportions here. The character supposedly represents some qualities which the wielder of the profile picture depicting that character “worships” as a part of that character’s godhood.

        Not convinced? Let me present a case-study for a particular character that I myself have taken a liking to: Natsume Iroha from Blue Archive. She is the right-hand woman of the head of the Pandemonium Society (the student council) of Gehenna Academy, located within the “Academy City” of Kivotos. (In reality, Kivotos is said to be larger than even Canada, and the districts of each academy are cities unto their own. Further, every student in Kivotos is a girl.) The students of Gehenna, its name essentially being Semitic for “hell”, are primarily demonic humanoids, which is to say that they are human girls but with horns and tails here and there. In keeping, lots of crazy happenings occur in Gehenna; almost every club seems to be willing to commit all sorts of crimes in order to achieve their desires. For instance, the Gourmet Research Society continually kidnaps the head of the School Lunch Club in order for her to chef up some unique dishes, and the Hot Springs Development Club detonates massive quantities of explosives in order to build hot springs everywhere.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        Within the thus aptly-named Pandemonium Society itself are various characters, but the chairwoman and character who primarily frames Iroha’s traits is Hanuma Makoto. Makoto is basically the wannabe führess of Gehenna, and is always looking for ways to assert her dominance over the student populace, and particularly over the Prefect Team (who are essentially Gehenna’s overworked peacekeeping corps). Iroha is one of the few level-headed characters in the entirety of Gehenna, and is constantly fed up with Makoto’s silly antics and errands, so she always finds ways to get out of doing work and take breaks. But when she finds a task worth doing, she will do it to the end. She remains strongly-opinionated but mostly subdued in the verbal expression of her true thoughts.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        In short, it can be easily said that the reason people like Iroha is because they identify with the sorts of situations (although exaggerated in her case) that she finds herself in, and her reactions to those situations. In other words, Iroha is “worshipped” as a “goddess” of detestation of meaningless tasks and of taking things easy, while still holding on firmly to one’s principles and doing what they believe in.

        Most real humans could not be framed in such a particular manner. Yet, we as humans thirst for targets of our admiration to use to guide our own meaning and existence in this world. Although not all characters are made with a similarly-sufficient level of depth in order to embody a full set of characters that a “god” should have, the plethora of characters which have thus far come into existence in our modern-day society presents one with no shortage of gods to admire and follow. In conclusion, I would suggest that characters fulfill a fundamental human need which day-to-day life and religion may not always be able to satisfy. Admiring (“worshipping”) characters which we can feel a true emotional connection with—because we can perceive them as real entities of a Godly substance, worthy of our human consideration—can provide us with guidance in our conduct which can supplement religious teachings and common sense, and can improve our sense of fulfillment. Just as prophets and saints are said to be Godly miracles via God’s creation—are characters not also capable of being Godly themselves, having derived from God’s creation?
