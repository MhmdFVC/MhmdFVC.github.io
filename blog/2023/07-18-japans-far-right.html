    <h1 class="blogtitle">Japan's Far-Right</h1> <i>2023-07-18</i>
    <p class="blogtext">
        So, Japan. It's the peaceful land of cherry blossoms, ancient shrines and temples, beautiful nature, four distinct seasons, high social cohesion, 
        low crime rate; of anime and visual novels, and a wide assortment of video games; of dedicated craftsmen and of social conservatism. It's
        a country that I have taken quite a liking to. Seems like a wonderland, right? Well, not to even get into the issues with its working culture,
        but I fear there is something dark lurking beneath the surface.
    </p>
    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p class="blogtext">
        I've recently been educating myself on World War II, particularly on what happened with the rise of Nazi Germany as well as the doings of the
        Japanese Empire. And oh boy. I think Japan was far more unsparing in its savagery compared to Germany. Although both were under the unquestionable
        command of their respective "great leaders", the Japanese treated all of their enemies with the same level of monstrosity, be they Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, American, British, or Australian.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        It seems that the Meiji emperor, after the so-called Restoration of the emperorship to de facto power and marking the end of the shogunate, 
        made the call that Japan ought to industrialize in order not to be conquered and colonized by Western powers. Seems reasonable, but to properly join the 
        race for world power, the emperor seemed to believe that creating an empire for Japan would be necessary. And so that's what happened. Though not much of
        their initial conquests in Korea, Manchuria, and Taiwan can be said to have been very graceful, it seems like the intensity of the brutality ramped up after 
        the ascension of the Shouwa emperor (commonly known by us as Hirohito). From what I understand, ultranationalism was gripping Japan at this time, potentially
        a byproduct of how easily they defeated China and Korea and as a mechanism to feel justified in what they were doing. The Shouwa emperor must have been partial
        to the ultranationalists as that is about when what semblance of democracy Japan had fell away, paving the path for the ultimate fascist dictatorship.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
         The whole thing with emperor-worship is pretty insane, though. They have a term, 万世一系 (bansei ikkei), which is used in reference to the oh-so-special
         unbroken line of emperors for over 2000 years, beginning with the sun god 天照 (amaterasu). As a Muslim I find the concept of being descended from a god to be
         fairly ridiculous, not to mention the concept of there even being gods besides the one ultimate God. But the Japanese are by and large not Muslims, 
         and even less so back in those days. Furthermore, the so-called unbroken family tree is perhaps a little dubious. I mean, billions of people could claim that 
         they are a direct descendant of Genghis Khan and so that they have the divine right over Mongolia, but who the hell cares? These sort of dynasties are 
         quite something.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        In any case, it may not have seemed strange in any way to the Japanese of that time that the emperor, as a direct descendant of a god, ought to have 
        the ultimate authority over Japan and should be obeyed fully without question. This would have likely been exacerbated by the blatant brainwashing propaganda
        education doled out to the masses in this time period, similar to the sort of stuff the Nazis brainwashed their people with. (Discussion about the 
        brainwashiness of modern education can be saved for another time.) One thing that gives hope that this isn't something inherent in the Japanese DNA or something
        is the fact that the warring states period (戦国時代) and the shogunate existed in the first place; there existed for centuries various forms of resistance and 
        local self-governance that totally ignored the emperors and left them as sitting ducks in Kyoto. Not that the standard of living would've been much better, 
        though. It was, as far as I know, still an "obey or die" sort of deal.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        Anyway, back to WWII. The soldiers and civilians alike, under orders that could ultimately be attributed to the god-emperor himself, were all-in on this
        bloodthirsty quest for domination of Asia, and even of perhaps America. The non-Japanese, being viewed as sub-humans, were treated as such without 
        discrimination. The Japanese valued their obedience to the emperor much more highly than their own lives; this is a concept I can understand in terms of 
        giving your life for a cause, but it's rather unfortunate that they did not use their own moral judgment to determine what was worth giving their lives for.
        They seemed rather eager to die for the emperor as an objective in of itself, even if they may not necessarily accomplish anything. Though oftentimes their 
        deaths did do something in the form of the banzai charges and kamikaze attacks.

        This feverish dedication is likely why Truman decided that the nukes were 
        necessary. Without some drastic demonstration of such a fearsome new weapon the likes of which the world had never seen, they would never back down. In 
        fact, it could be said that the nukes saved Japan. If not for those, Japan may never have surrendered and the remainder of its cities may have been 
        burned entirely to the ground, with many more millions of lives lost. It's sad, and I really hate that the nukes were dropped, and it pains me to consider
        this, but it indeed may have been the right call. So after they lost their insane war and their era of imperialism was well and truly over, they got 
        occupied by us, and the purging of their emperor-worship began. At first we were rather harsh with those Japanese deemed as war criminals, but of course 
        after the Cold War began, we just let them off the hook as though nothing had happened. And above all, the Shouwa emperor was not removed from his post, 
        and the emperorship was never abolished. This could have also been the right call from some perspective, but still, what the heck? The Shouwa emperor was 
        responsible for the deaths of millions upon millions, and was also responsible for beckoning the destruction of his own country and people.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        Nonetheless, the persisting faith in the emperor coupled with the sudden loss of the emperorship or even the execution of the emperor may not have boded 
        very well for the occupiers. It's hard to imagine there would be much cooperation from such a mind-controlled herd if some mercy was not shown for their 
        god emperor. So I suppose we can, for the time being, suppose that this was also the right call. Nevertheless, traces of this ultranationalist extremism 
        remained, and remain to this day. And now, I finally get to my main point.
    </p>
    <h2>Japanese Ultranationalism in the Modern Day</h2>
    <p class="blogtext">
        It's hard to avoid the scourge of ultranationalism and fascism when you're browsing the Web. So as someone who occasionally browses those Japanese 
        areas of the Web, of course I will come into contact with those who despise the non-Japanese (particularly Chinese and Koreans, go figure) and are 
        able to provide fairly convincing reasons as to why. The unfortunate reality is that the Japanese have every reason to feel superior to other Asian peoples 
        based on their own perceived and often-touted characteristics which they take pride in and that make Japan popular internationally. So I imagine that 
        it may not take very much effort for bad actors to gently coax the Japanese into once again falling into fascism, albeit in perhaps a different form than 
        back in the imperial days. Even recently, the former Prime Minister 
        Abe would often visit Yasukuni Shrine (靖国神社) to pay his respects. If you don't know, Yasukuni is related to the "national protection shrines" 
        (護国神社) which were only established after the Meiji Restoration. So in plain terms after having discussed part of the relevant historical background, 
        Yasukuni is a place to pay respects to people who committed savage acts against imperial Japan's occupied territories, and who ordered these atrocities.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        Of course, the righties will spin this as paying respects to those who gave their lives for the country, and those who died an honorable death. I get 
        where they're coming from, but it's still quite revealing that there is still an inclination to publicly pay respects to these people and that they remain 
        enshrined in such a showy manner; if there are to be war memorials, let them stay on the down low. I suspect this tradition probably carried over from the 
        war criminals and war-criminal sympathizers left over from the half-assed purge by the American occupation authorities, and is the root of the ultranationalist 
        sentiment that can be observed today. With the economic stagnation in Japan continuing, the dual crises of low birthrate and high aging, and backlash against 
        the non-confirmity to Japanese social norms by some foreign residents, it seems like turning to ultranationalism may be an attractive prospect for an increasing 
        number of Japanese people. 
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        Nevertheless, as far as I can see (which isn't very far from over here in Maryland), there is no far-right wave washing over Japan as of yet. The LDP 
        (Liberal Democratic Party), a center-right party, has been the winning party in Japanese politics for quite some time now; this is the party that the 
        Yasukuni-visiting Abe hailed from, and several of its members are also known to be fairly anti-Korean. But Japan, being the world capital of 
        entertainment in the form of cutting-edge innovations and kino media, has its male population well and truly sedated. It's hard to imagine a bloodthirsty mob 
        of Korea-haters rising up in my lifetime. But hey, who knows? If their collective honor is on the line, maybe there will be a proper organized movement to 
        do something to save their country, if indeed they fear that the country is in jeopardy. I don't know whether that will mean more liberalism or more 
        ultranationalism, or even both sides of that coin getting more extreme. We will have to see.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        On the other hand, perhaps the aging population will be taken 
        as it is and not treated as a real crisis by the population. If they dislike the notion of widescale immigration, they may start performing pogroms. 
        If immigration is curbed and the population continues to decline, they may find novel ways to deal with the situation rather than bend the knee in the name of 
        curbing economic stagnation. Another thing is that due to the ever-worsening financial burden of the aging population on the shrinking young population, 
        an unspeakable anti-elderly sentiment may even develop. This would be rather extreme and would run counter to a core aspect of Japanese mannerisms however, 
        which is respect for one's elders (anyone older than oneself, not just the elderly) and for one's parents in particular.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        Still, I should have no reason to worry. Most Japanese people I have encountered seem genuinely friendly and helpful, and even those who may have harbored a
        dislike of foreigners at least had the decency not to treat me with disrespect. I think Japan is in a much more dignified state of existence than it was in the 
        imperial days and in the centuries before that time, so I should hope that they don't collectively see fit to devolve to a savage state of being. And let's 
        be real, they would be shut down by us again if that were to ever happen.
    </p>
    <p class="blogtext">
        These phenomena are things to keep an eye out on; Japan, China, and Korea have taken our societal phenomena and put them on steroids, 
        so if we observe what happens to those countries in their hard slump of post-industrialization, we might yet be able to take suitable measures 
        to address the problems domestically.
